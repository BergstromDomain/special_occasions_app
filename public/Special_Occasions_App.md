Special Occasions App
==================================================
This summary is my documentation of getting started with _Ruby on Rails_. I'm building a basic application to keep track of special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. I'm using _Test Driven Development_ practices and I'm documenting the errors I'm getting as well as the steps I'm taking to resolve them. It's written as a reference guide for myself but hopefully it will be useful for you as well.
